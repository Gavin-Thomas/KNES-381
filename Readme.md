### Prologue

  _On the day I stepped into the kinesiology computer lab at the University of Calgary, little did I know that the class I was about to begin would have a profound impact on my personal and professional development, and inspire me to integrate technology with my career. Over the past few months this course has singlehandedly reinvigorated my love for learning, as I believe I have found something I am passionate about. That is... learning to code and applying it to real world settings._
  
  Small disclaimer: I am a complete beginner and am in no stretch of the imagination technically proficient in machine learning or data science (yet). However, through many hours of banging my head against my keyboard, I have actually figured out a few things and have found this process of applying code to real-world problems to be very fruitful.
